# Modeling-Nature-Interactions
Here I will store Pov-Ray scripts and -approaches for modeling structures with interacting elements. 
I will look at three different kinds of interactions: (1) Interactions modifying the location and/or orientation of element, (2) Interactions modifying the shape of elements and (3) interactions modifying the texture (colour) of elements. 
Let's start with a simple example for (1). Cases where only elements inside a given larger element are displayed. This kind of interactions can be easily modeled in Pov-Ray using the inside-funktion - here are a few examples.
