# Modeling-Nature-Interactions
Here I will store Pov-Ray scripts and -approaches for modeling structures with interacting elements. 
I will look at three different kinds of interactions: (1) Interactions modifying the location and/or orientation of element, (2) Interactions modifying the shape of elements and (3) interactions modifying the texture (colour) of elements. 
Let's start with a simple example for (1). Cases where only elements inside a given larger element are displayed. This kind of interactions can be easily modeled in Pov-Ray using the inside-funktion - here are a few examples.

Using the inside function it is also possible to place objects on the surface of a large object by making them moving towards the object until they reach the surface. ![envelopeb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49971bd1-b205-4e77-b5ee-24fbd03467ba)
The next form of interactions refers to the orientation of a given object. In the next examples I will show how to orientate the objects according to the normal of the surface of the large object. (In this example the large object is a virus and the small particles are viral proteins.

There are also cases where one element determines location (and eventually orientation of a subsequent element. Worms can be modeled this way (for example).

By modifying the shape of individual elements different kinds of worms are possible:

But also Anabaena filaments can be modeled by adding stepwise elements to the growing chain

Below I will show you a few examples, where elements modify each others shape. We start with soap bubbles (simple models for cells) and end with plant cells.
